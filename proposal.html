    <title>My Personal Website</title>

    <p>
        This website would be about me and the outfits that I be styling on most of the days I decide to dress up.
        It would be composed of the different articles of clothing and the different ways I style them myself. I
        think it would be cool to see my outfits of the day and the reasons as to why I wear it on the specific day
        as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        The objective of my website is to keep track of my outfits that I wear from day to day. I just want to see the
        reasons behind what I wear and keep a catalog of my clothes as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        My target audience would be people around my age or that are interested in fashion like me.

        I plan to have a page of just a catalog of all of my clothes. I would have another of the outfits that I wear. I
        would possibly have a page where I can sell any clothes that I do not want or do not fit me. I will have another
        page that will redirect them to my social media accounts that would have more content about me and the clothes
        that I will be wearing
